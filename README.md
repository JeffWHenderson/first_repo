this is my read me file

i created directory by:

mkdir my_new_directory
touch README.md //this made file in directory
echo "this is my read me file" > README.md // added code to README

// made a repo on github website // (not in console)
git init // initialize empty git repo
git add . // "." means all files
git commit -m "initialize git" // -m is symbol for message, add description in quotes after -m
git remote add origin git@github.com:userNameToString/first_repo.git // after "origin" is the ssh code from git
